## Missing the Windows XP Dinosaur mouse pointers?
Bring them back to life in Windows 10/11 with this ...

----

Download the two animation files from the folder: [files](files)

![file icons](images/file_icons.png)

Save them to C:\Windows\Cursors

Then open:

Settings -> Mouse -> Additional mouse options

Then from Pointers tab:

Change 'Working in background' and 'Busy' pointers

YMMV, comments welcome!
